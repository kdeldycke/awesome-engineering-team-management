  <i>The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.</i><br>
  — Tom DeMarco<sup id="intro-quote-ref"><a href="#intro-quote-def">[1]</a></sup>
</p>

A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions, industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last few years while [transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager](https://devtomanager.com/interviews/kevin-deldycke/). And later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right? ʘ‿ʘ).

- You're a developer and wonders what it feels like to be a manager?
- You just started your first position as the leader of a team?
- You're stuck into the day-to-day operations of the job?
- How can I move up to the next level?

You'll find answers in this guide! It stands out from generic leadership and management literature, by providing uncompromising insights and practical advices to bootstrap your journey into the management career track, from a technical background.

This list provides a progression to help with the transition to management. From general to specifics. It starts with an overview of the role, then describes its requirements, and its position relative to others. Then we delves into the day-to-day tools of the trade, both organizational and behavioral. At last we discuss about some of the dark sides of the job.

## Engineering to Management Transition

The first step. The hardest: how to requalify oneself from an Individual Contributor (IC) to a front-line manager.

- [Why It's Easier to Manage 4 People Than It Is to Manage 1 Person](https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/07/24/Managing-One-Person.html) - “Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.”

- [Going from Developer to Manager. What should I know or learn?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18823616)

- [Responsibility vs. accountability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21892816) - The biggest difference between manager (accountable) and engineers (responsible): “'Bad things' happen for the person accountable, whereas the person responsible can move on to the next project.”

- “A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision.” - An [IBM slide from 1979](https://twitter.com/mit_csail/status/1604884273789603842).

- “It is a job where your goal is to try disappoint people most slowly.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18222488)).

- “So the trick is basically to put them (your direct reports) in charge, not you. You have the supporting role, they can request things from you. But the goal needs to be very clear.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23973859)) - A recipe on how to work with your direct reports, from a section of [7 habits of highly effective people](https://amzn.com/B01069X4H0/?tag=kevideld-20).

From this, the book teach you how to change from taking on responsibilities to delegating them so you don't become a bottleneck.

## Building Teams

You got the title and the pay grade. Congratulation! This doesn't make you a manager yet. Whether you inherit an already existing team or have to start from scratch, you'll need to practice the art of building (and consolidating) them.

- [Building and Motivating Engineering Teams](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/11/building-and-motivating-engineering.html) - What DO engineers want? Money, purpose and respect.

- [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - “Google's data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (…) The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.”

- [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - “The practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.”

- [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes-2/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article “would be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.”

## Roles

On the profiles, attitude, behaviors, and expectations between developers, managers and executives.

### Executives

Executives are the senior/highest management layers of a company. They reports to a board of directors in bigger companies, or directly to the shareholders in smaller ones. Leadership is expected at this level. As a manager these are the people you report to.

- [What do executives do, anyway?](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926) - Paraphrasing [Andy Grove's book, High Output Management](https://amzn.com/0679762884/?tag=kevideld-20), “the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.” The article also details the failures modes of a CEO: forcing his own decisions downstream, or various ways of not resolving conflicts.

- [Executives ratify decisions made on the spot](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1088001688722644992) - Refines the concept above adapting [Tolstoy's thesis to business](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18089716).

- [Army Leadership and the Profession](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/adp6_22.pdf) - Establishes and describes what leaders should be and do.

- [US Air Force's Strategic Leadership Studies](http://leadership.au.af.mil/sls-skil.htm) - A reference of leadership's competencies and skills.

- [What Only the CEO Can Do](https://hbr.org/2009/05/what-only-the-ceo-can-do) - “1. Defining and interpreting the meaningful "outside" of the company; 2. Answering the two-part question: What business are we in and what business are we not in? 3. Balancing sufficient yield in the present with necessary investment in the future; 4. Shaping the values and standards of the organization.”

- [How CEOs Manage Time](https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-leaders-calendar) - A study on what CEO of large companies spent their time on, and how. Opens a new window into what leadership is all about and into its many components and dimensions.

- [Operations and Internal Communication Strategies For Effective CEOs](https://www.sametab.com/blog/operations-and-internal-communication-strategies-for-effective-ceos) - After insisting on the importance of context and narratives, the author provide an interesting template (good for inspiration) of ritual and recurring internal communication devices.

- [Regis McKenna's talk at Silicon Valley Leaders Symposium](https://youtu.be/5Z13NI0SuyA?t=2026) - “These are the things we (marketers) used to do with individuals and bodies. They've all become automated. The CIO is the marketing chief now.”

- [Narcissistic CEOs Weaken Collaboration and Integrity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/narcissistic-ceos-weaken-collaboration-integrity) - “The prototypic visionary leader profile is so similar to that of a narcissist, if boards aren't careful, they're going to end up choosing people who are narcissistic as CEOs”.

- “Hiring isn't the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.” ([source](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).

- “The CEO positions himself as a controlling, micromanaging individual at the center of everything. This makes it possible for the CEO to intercept financials and other crucial numbers en route to people who might catch on.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24519247)) - Or how fraud can endure at the top level. That's generally why you need a board of directors as an oversight.

### CTO & VP of Engineering

In tech companies these roles are critical, and the frontier between the two is often blurry.

- [CTO vs VP Engineering: What's the Difference?](https://www.ivyexec.com/career-advice/2015/cto-versus-vp-engineering-whats-the-difference/) - CTO manage a small staff of hackers. VP of Engineering lead an organization of engineers.

- [Want to Know the Difference Between a CTO and a VP Engineering?](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-the-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-engineering-4fc3750c596b) - Another way to look at thing: placing these roles along the “Process Orientation” and “Technical Capability” quadrants.

- [The different skills needed to be a successful CTO](https://madewithlove.be/one-job-many-roles-the-different-skills-needed-to-be-a-successful-cto/) - The premise is a little misleading, as what is detailed there is the journey, in a startup, of the technical founder growing with the company to become a CTO. At which point the position described in the article is not CTO, but VP of Engineering.

- [Hiring a VP of Engineering? Use This Framework](https://review.firstround.com/hiring-a-vp-of-engineering-use-this-framework-from-shopify%27s-vpe-to-get-it-right) - “*How do I hire a VP of Engineering?* After more than 20 years, eight companies, and thousands of hires, I'm starting to suspect this may be the wrong question.

### Engineering Managers

Managers came in all form and shape, and the title and daily activities varies a lot depending on companies. When developers directly reports to you, you'll find yourself at the first management level: you are a front-line engineering manager.

- [What are the signs that you have a great manager?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20230133) - “The irony is that you don't really notice a great manager.”

### Consultants

- “A consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).

- “The value that most orgs get from a consultant (…) is the political cover to make changes they knew they should make all along, but didn't have the social capital or the focus to make those changes” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714791)). And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

- [The Prosperous Software Consultant](https://dabit3.medium.com/the-prosperous-software-consultant-5dc8d705c5dd) - This article let you understand how an independent consultant operates.

## Recruitment

You're in a competitive sector in which talents are in high demand. Be prepared as a manager to spend a lot of time recruiting people, either to expand your team or fill-in open positions. The dynamics gets interesting too, as you are now on both sides of the hiring process: as a candidate to get a job, and as a recruiter to staff up your team.

### Job Boards

By targeting the right place to post your job offer to, you're increasing your chances of targeting the right candidates.

- [TechMeAbroad](https://techmeabroad.com) - List job posts from tech startups and tech companies who will recruit from abroad.

### Hiring Process

High-growth company will all need to industrialize the hiring process at one point.

- [Hire people who aren't proven](https://leonardofed.io/blog/startups-hiring.html) - If anyone else in the world can objectively assess a candidate to be a great player, then you and your startup won't be able to hire the player. Someone will steal the candidate from you. That's why you have to go after people that aren't proven. In short, you need to be extremely good at forecasting talent.

- [Why I Never Hire Brilliant Men](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Why_I_Never_Hire_Brilliant_Men) - 5 simple rules for hiring men, from 1924. Things haven't changed a lot in a century.

- [Open Sourced Interview Process](https://github.com/cockroachlabs/open-sourced-interview-process) - Cockroach Labs published their process “to create familiarity for candidates and account for bias, resulting in a better candidate experience and hiring decisions.”

- [Rethinking the Hiring Process](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring) - “Testing programmers at something they aren't actually expected to be good at and expecting to learn something about how they would work at your company is delusional, and I think these kind of interviews only serve to make the hiring team feel smarter and ensure better outcomes for engineers with traditional CS backgrounds.”

### Interview

List of questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates, and topics to draw inspiration from to be used as conversation starters.

- [The Technical Interview is an Ego Trip](https://blog.kowsheek.com/the-technical-interview-is-an-ego-trip/) - Starts with anecdote of developers using a job interview as a vehicule to demonstrate their superiority. Then the author details a reasonable interview process that is trying to not waste anyone's time.

- “It's true that not all developers make positive contributions, however, I think that blaming "lowering hiring standards" (…) is a complete red herring.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13209317)) - Examples in which developers that might pass tough job interview just fine are bringing negative value later.

### Coding Challenge

The absence of coding exercise will left the door open to fraud. OTOH, if elitist challenges decrease the number of false-positive, you will pass on perfectly capable and great developers. Now it is your job as manager to find balance between these two extremes, and set the tone on how to have the candidate demonstrate coding skills.

- [How to Freaking Find Great Developers By Having Them Read Code](https://freakingrectangle.com/2022/04/15/how-to-freaking-hire-great-developers/) - “Instead of writing code, consider having the candidate read existing code and talk about how it works. 1) Reading code is 95% of what a developer does as part of their job. 2) A candidate can tell you a lot about their programming skill in the first five minutes of reading. 3) Stress is your enemy because it raises adrenaline which lowers IQ by several points, causing you to miss good candidates.”

- [Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry](https://prog21.dadgum.com/177.html) - “When it comes to writing code, the number one most important skill is how to keep a tangle of features from collapsing under the weight of its own complexity.”

- [Optimize Onboarding](https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/08/28/Optimize-Onboarding.html) - “Your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do.”

- [As a manager of a new employee I make an absolute point of being a "helicopter mom" from the moment they hit the area until about week 2 or 3](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24404676) - Navigating a new organization will be hard the first few weeks, and the presence of a manager can help speed things up.

### Problem Solving

- [First principles and asking why](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/first-principles-and-asking-why/) - “Our ability to think in abstractions can weaken our judgement, as those abstractions may no longer be as true as they once were. Also a similarly dangerous evolutionary trait is our ability to think in analogy, where we make assumptions based on the comparison of two things that are not actually related.” [Elon Musk explains it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI).

- “People who excel at software design become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.” - A reminder of the needs of humility and recognition of limits in our industry, [from a panel on the Moral Economy of Tech](https://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm).

- [The Art of Powerful Questions - Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action](https://umanitoba.ca/admin/human_resources/change/media/the-art-of-powerful-questions.pdf) - “Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for fostering breakthrough thinking.”

### Systems

It is often called 'the meta'. (…) The meta is what you get after you master boring fundamentals. But observing the state of the current meta often reveals what boring fundamentals you need to learn.”

### Brainstorming

- [Yes, and…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...) - “A rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy (…). It is also used in business and other organizations as a principle that improves the effectiveness of the brainstorming process, fosters effective communication, and encourages the free sharing of ideas.”

- [On Bullshit](http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/twimberley/EnviroPhilo/bullshit.pdf) - This [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23147605) perfectly describes the concept. “Unlike lying/fraud, where falsehood is instrumental, Frankfurt defined bullshit as potentially false speech where the truth *simply wasn't important*. Bullshit is characterized by giving the *surface appearance* of confidence, intelligence, or a convincing argument; whether it's actually true or not is besides the point.”

## Team Dynamics

On the day-to-day dynamics of the team, and its interaction with other teams.

- [How to Celebrate the Small Wins](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-celebrate-the-small-wins-4a03004a1816) - My takeaway: “Celebrating Slow Progress; Hunt for Key Milestones”.

Still, there is some cases in which it might put your collegue in a tight spot. So always ask if it's ok first.

- [Eye Candy QA](https://techreflect.net/2020/01/05/eye-candy-qa-2005-2011/) - Retelling of author's job at Apple: “John Louch was my boss. (…) John always shared everything with us, even the *don't share this with your team* stuff. We were people he trusted, so it was as it should be. It made you feel like you were part of something greater.” Or why sharing some open secret promote strong trust in your entourage.

- [A conversation with Elon Musk about Starship](https://youtu.be/cIQ36Kt7UVg?t=203) - In a team with very talented contributors, everyone's is a chief engineer: you are expected to challenge the status-quo and questions other department's constraints.

- “Community already exists, you just create a communication platform for it” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21828666)) - Or why trying to create a community from the ground up might not be the right way of looking at things: a better and more subtle strategy would be to empowers the already existing channels and make them visible.

- [OpenTeams](https://openteam.info) - “Teams can visualize their network of interactions, and also, cross this data with information on a teams demographic, professional, and psychological characteristics.” As manager, make sure these metrics bring positive outcome to the team. It is easy to have them instrumentalized for political reasons.

## Engineering

You're no longer an engineer. Still, your team is responsible for the systems, technology and all the processes surrounding them. You'd better know a bit about engineering tenets.

### The Technical Engineering Manager

You shouldn't spend your time coding. Leave that to the engineers: your value lies elsewhere now. But does that means you must forget all things technical? The answer is an astounding *NO*. Here are some arguments:

- [Do engineering managers need to be technical?](https://increment.com/teams/do-engineering-managers-need-to-be-technical/) - Yes. “Looking forward to the next 30 years of management trends, only a few things seem certain: Managers should be technical, and the definition of technical will continue to change.”

- [If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work](https://hbr.org/2016/12/if-your-boss-could-do-your-job-youre-more-likely-to-be-happy-at-work) - “Although we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work – type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance – they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.”

- “The best managers I met tended to be those that if the circumstance required it, could do the job of those two levels below.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23891984)) - Another way of putting it: managers needs domain knowledge and to know the work their reports do.

- “Over the years we have developed the policy that it is important for the supervisor to thoroughly know and understand the work of his group.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20683609)) - This quote is [from David Packard](https://amzn.com/0060845791/?tag=kevideld-20) (HP co-founder), decades before current [management fad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_fad).

### Systems Complexity

Whatever the technical stack, we are building systems first, and have to manage its complexity.

- [Second-system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) - “Tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems”.

- [Living with Complexity, by Donald A. Norman](https://amzn.com/0262014866/?tag=kevideld-20) - In which we learn that, based on [Tesler's law of the conservation of complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity), “the total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person's interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex.”

- [The Efficiency-Destroying Magic of Tidying Up](https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2019/09/04/the-efficiency-destroying-magic-of-tidying-up/) - “Efficiency tends to look messy, and good looks tend to be inefficient.” A reminder that sometimes we should just accept [the messiness of the world](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood).

- [I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400) - An engineer's perspective on which priorities should be addressed first to increase robustness of systems.

- [SpaceX's 5-Step design and manufacturing process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t705r8ICkRw&t=13m30s) - “1. Make requirement less dumb; 2. Try to delete parts; 3. Simplify or optimize; 4. Accelerate cycle time; 5. Automate”. See [full transcript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28517976).

### Technology

- [Choose Boring Technology](http://boringtechnology.club) - “Boring, in the sense that it's well understood.”

- [Choose Well-known Technology](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23445535) - A rephrasing of the above advice. “Choose the technology: 1. You know in and out, and are immediately productive with; 2. Which is sure to be around in 5-7 years, preferably 10-15; 3. For which you are comfortable hiring the next 15 engineers.”

- [Industry Data Models](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/) - A huge list of database templates to represent any business process.

- [I thought that using loops was cheating…](https://www.facebook.com/spliceofficial/photos/a.555206991212765/679408552125941/?type=1&theater) - How much is too much? Libraries, whether software or audio loops, are tools. A typical case of [NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) transposed to music production.

- “Lots of people make the mistake of thinking there's only two vectors you can go to improve performance, high or wide. High - throw hardware at the problem, on a single machine. Wide - add more machines. [There's a third direction you can go, I call it *going deep*.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8902739)”

- [You need to be this tall to use (micro) services](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12509533) - Do not chase the hype. Yet. Micro-services only brings value past a certain infrastructure and organization size. This is a list of stuff you should focus on before bringing micro-services to the mix.

- [LEGO blocks and organ transplants](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/) - “People have been comparing software components to LEGO blocks for a couple decades. (…) Integrating two software systems is usually more like performing a heart transplant than snapping together LEGO blocks.”

### Engineering Practices

- [Software Engineering's Greatest Hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVtA-ue-x0) - When scientific method meet the practice of software development. My takeaways: the best metric is less lines of code, there is no 10x developers, too much unused configuration options, pair programing is for transfer of domain-specific knowledge and hackathon don't produce long term projects.

- [Code reviews at Google](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/blob/master/review/reviewer/speed.md#why-should-code-reviews-be-fast-why) - “Why Should Code Reviews Be Fast? (…) To optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer can write code.”

- [Google Engineering Practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/) - Explains how to perform code reviews and how to submit them.

- [Embedded Rules of Thumb](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2018/04/26/embedded-rules-of-thumb/) - Guidelines and heuristics to provide a reasonable approximation of the truth while developing embedded devices. Most also applies to software projects in general.

- [How to Misuse Code Coverage](http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Marick_coverage.pdf) - “If a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it's likely also weak in a way coverage can't detect.” I.e. the great benefit of a coverage report is that it tells you what you forgot to think about when you wrote the test suite itself ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28678098)).

### Technical Debt

- [Tech Due Diligence Calculator](https://decodingvc.gitbooks.io/p9-startup-tech-due-diligence-calculator/content/) - A list of questions by topic to help understand how you are building your tech and engineering team, trying to highlight red flags.

- [Technical Debt Is Like Tetris](https://medium.com/s/story/technical-debt-is-like-tetris-168f64d8b700) - Another way to explain technical debt: “Scenarios like these create technical debt within the product code. A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (…) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.”

- [Technical debt as a lack of understanding](https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/) - “The problem lies in "never reorganizing \[the code\] to reflect your understanding." (…) Organizationally, you pay in velocity and turnover; talented people are going to leave after a few rounds of bullshit.”

- [The Framing of the Developer](https://www.svese.de/impact-vs-backlog-frame-in-software-development) - Default framing is around the backlog, which leads to an asymmetry in which failure is blamed on lacks of developer performance, and success is celebrated as the full realization of the PM's vision. But “technology is the bank that gave credit”, and technical debt should be called product debt “because product took the credit to get a feature faster and must pay back by investing the time to clean up.” The alternative? “Companies today need a frame of impact. In this world-view success is defined by impact.”

- [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/) - “My boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was clean! (…) I see now that my 'refactoring' was a disaster in two ways: I didn't talk to the person who wrote it; My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication”.

## Remote Work

- [The Surprising Traits of Good Remote Leaders](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200827-why-in-person-leaders-may-not-be-the-best-virtual-ones) - “the confidence, intelligence and extroversion that have long propelled ambitious workers into the executive suite are not enough online because they simply don't translate into virtual leadership. (…) Instead, workers who are organized, dependable and productive take the reins of virtual teams.” As the [source paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-020-09698-0) say it best: “virtually, the emphasis shifts from saying to doing.”

- [Things to look for when hiring remote workers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17022563) - “1. You have to adhere to employment laws within the country you're hiring from; 2. To employ someone full time, many countries require you to have a legally entity within that country; 3. Prioritize countries where we have the most interest; 4. Keep a healthy timezone overlap in each of our teams.”

## Meetings

Two humans + a (virtual) room = a meeting.

- [Dear Manager, You're Holding Too Many Meetings](https://hbr.org/2022/03/dear-manager-youre-holding-too-many-meetings) - “Employee productivity was 71% higher when meetings were reduced by 40%. This is largely because employees felt more empowered and autonomous. Rather than a schedule being the boss, they owned their to-do lists and held themselves accountable.”

### 1 on 1

The most important meetings you'll have are frequent 1:1s with your direct reports.

- “1on1s are the managers Swiss army knife” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22341739)) - Another advice from the source: make them walk'n'talks.

- [Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) - A personal list of high-level questions from a manager.

- [1 on 1 Meeting Questions](https://github.com/VGraupera/1on1-questions) - A mega list in which most of them are great starters for conversation, some others are clearly bad ideas. A great source of inspiration nonetheless, but choose carefully.

### Standups

A staple of agile decorum, too often misused.

- [Your daily standups should be async. Here's why](https://www.cadencework.com/blog/async-standups.html) - “Daily, real-time meetings aren't practical for remote teams” might be the best practical reason.

- [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Standup](https://kristoff.it/blog/good-bad-ugly-standup/) - Author experienced 3 formats of stand-ups before ending with one working for his team, and concludes that “the details that make up a good meeting are subtle and the pursuit of an artificial standard of aesthetics will prevent you from doing the necessary experimentation to improve from an ugly equilibrium”.

- [We Cancelled Standups and Let The Team Build. Here's What Happened…](https://www.usehaystack.io/blog/we-cancelled-standups-and-let-the-team-build-heres-what-happened) - Team felt burned out by long, daily status update meetings masquerading as standups. Eliminating these faux standups got the team back on track.

## Facilities

The environment we work in shapes us. Perks too.

The engineers were very upset, but it was just soda and they could afford it. But really it wasn't soda. Soda was the canary in the coal mine, triggering an exodus of its best engineers.

## Product Management

The Product Manager is supposed to be the *voice of the market*. Here are more links on the role and its reach.

- [I wasted \$40k on a fantastic startup idea](https://tjcx.me/posts/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea/) - A tale of building a product no user want to pay for. “You can't just create value for the user: that's a charity. You also can't just create value for your company: that's a scam. Your goal is to set up some kind of positive-sum exchange, where everyone benefits, including you. A business plan, according to this textbook, starts with this simple question: how will you create value for yourself and the company?”

## Project Management

If product management is about *what* is to be developed of the product, then project management activities answers on *how* to deliver that development. It is all about the execution, with a particular attention to delivery critical path and planning.

But don't worry too much, every company has its own definition of the two roles, and sometimes hybrid positions.

- [Let's have no managers, instead of managers with no engineering experience](https://medium.com/hackernoon/lets-have-no-managers-instead-of-managers-with-no-engineering-experience-e8b7cd29d398) - The title is misleading, article's argument is: we don't need *project* managers if we already have *product* managers and scrum masters.

- [Best project management practices in 2018?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16377523) - There is no silver bullet.

- [Strategies for long Projects](http://benbrostoff.github.io/2019/09/28/long-projects.html) - Relentless, irrational optimism; Daily progress documentation; Compounding investments; Time budgeting.

- [Developers can't fix bad management](https://iism.org/article/developers-can-t-fix-bad-management-57) - “Why do so many software projects fail? Software development is much closer to creating a new factory than running an existing factory. (…) Software development is made up of many unknown duration tasks, this fundamentally unpredictable nature makes traditional management's predictive planning techniques particularly unsuited for software projects.”

### Specifications

- “Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.” Edward V. Berard - [Essays on object-oriented software engineering](https://amzn.com/0132888955/?tag=kevideld-20).

- [The art of destroying software](https://vimeo.com/108441214) - Greg Young described a good way to deal with requirements volatility: optimize from the beginning to be able to delete your code, and structure your code so that any part of it is no bigger than 1 week's worth of coding. So that any part can be re-written in 1 week.

- [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/) - “Start by accepting that change is inevitable. (…) As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned. (…) This means that no software product is ever exactly, perfectly satisfactory.”

### Estimations

Time management and planning starts with estimates, but often degenerates into deadlines.

- [Don't (guess)timate your projects, forecast with confidence](https://www.reaktor.com/blog/forecasting-method/) - “The problem with spending a lot of time on estimating is that it can feel useful, but often is so inaccurate that it hardly yields much value to the business.” The best we can do is measure and forecast.

- [Dear Startup: You have no idea how much that costs](http://kyleprifogle.com/dear-startup/) - “We are completely clueless about how long things should take.” Here is a [trick to handle expectation of unreasonable estimates](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21069178).

- [Escalation of commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) - A.k.a. sunk-cost fallacy, or the rational explanation of why the hell do we still irrationally keep investing in a bad project.

- [Who are you trying to impress with your deadlines?](http://jatins.gitlab.io/me/why-deadline/) - “There are companies where those deadlines are set in stone, and a missed deadline is next to fire. That's when the problem starts.”

- [Apple Aperture: Senior QA](https://techreflect.net/2019/12/10/aperture-senior-qa-2004-2005/) - How not to manage projects approaching deadlines: “cutting finished features, yelling at people, and working people to the point of nervous breakdowns. Then they came upon a brilliant idea: let's steal over a hundred engineers from other teams and then the project will magically get done on time.”

- [Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin talk about professionalism in software development](https://youtu.be/LmRl0D-RkPU?t=3202) - The only honest estimate is "I don't know". But you can come up with some kind of propability assessment, that will inform about the shape of the risk. This is not unlike PERT, where an activity is bounded by [optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique#Time). Now if managers don't take a range for an answer, don't fall in that trap. Tell them you're already trying as you possibly can. “And then the manager will have to do something very foreign: they'll have to manage. That's what management is: managing risk.”

- [Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html) - “Confirms the hunch that developers estimate the median well, but the mean ends up being much higher.”

- [Developers spend most of their time figuring the system out](https://lepiter.io/feenk/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-9q25taswlbzjc5rsufndeu0py/) - “A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering. (…) As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems.” And that's why it is hard to estimate software projects: because developer's main activity is a long process of deducting the assumptions a system is built on.

### Tickets

- [There Are No Bugs, Just TODOs](https://almad.blog/essays/no-bugs-just-todos/) - Issue trackers needs to materialize ownership, queue position, state, task breakdown and aggressive closing. Priority, ticket type, software version, severity and long-life tickets are anti-patterns.

- [GitHub labels for reuse across projects](https://twitter.com/abdonrd/status/991697736230633474) - Simple yet practical.

## Agile

- [The SAFe Delusion](https://safedelusion.com) - Curated review of facts, evidence, and opinions from relevant sources without vested interests, to help decision-makers make informed choices and get better results.

- [Why do some developers at Google consider Agile development to be nonsense?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-developers-at-strong-companies-like-Google-consider-Agile-development-to-be-nonsense/answer/David-Jeske) - Because the short-term focused Scrum processes “seem suited to particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs the show because they are paying for development, and can change their mind at any time”. Still, google engineers already practice a culture close to what looks like the original 10-points Agile manifesto. But that's it.

- [Detecting Agile Bullshit](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF) - US Department of Defense guide to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (“agile-scrum-fall”).

- “The fundamental problem that drives most agile failures isn't in the team's execution, it's in the business' expectations. One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20326074))

- [Failed #SquadGoals - Spotify doesn't use "the Spotify model" and neither should you](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/) - “Why it didn't work? 1. Matrix management solved the wrong problem; 2. It fixated on team autonomy; 3. Collaboration was an assumed competency; 4. Mythology became difficult to change”.

- [Recurring opinions or productive improvements — what agile teams actually discuss in retrospectives](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-016-9464-2) - An 3-years analysis of a team's retrospectives, with dire conclusions: people keep forgetting what they already learned, keep discussing unsolveable problems out of their control, and keep debating opinions based on biased interpretations or incorrect understandings.

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

KPIs are a set of quantitative measurements at the team or organizational level, to measure the success of the business.

- “Numerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.” - [W. Edwards Deming](https://quotes.deming.org/authors/W._Edwards_Deming/quote/2068-2)

- [SRE fundamentals: SLIs, SLAs and SLOs](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos.html) - If you are in the business of cloud services, these metrics are certainly great KPIs.

- [The 4 Worst Software Metrics Agitating Developers in 2019](https://www.gitclear.com/blog/the_4_worst_software_metrics_agitating_developers_in_2019) - The worst KPIs to track a software team output: Lines of Code, Commit Count, Issues Resolved (aka “Shipping Velocity”) and Code Churn (aka "Efficiency").

## Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

OKRs are a framework. Extending KPIs, they applies individually to each members of an organization, down to the IC level. In theory, everyone is supposed to have its own set of OKRs.

- [OKRs from a development team's perspective](https://zafulabs.com/2019/05/24/okrs-from-a-development-teams-perspective/) - On how OKRs articulates with a backlog.

- [Team Objectives – Overview](https://svpg.com/team-objectives-overview/) - Why OKRs might not work at your company: 1. You're still using feature teams instead of product teams; 2. Mixed-up manager and individual objectives; 3. Leadership opting-out of active management.

- “One way in which I've seen OKRs used effectively is as a defense against the type of middle or upper manager who is constantly coming up with new ideas or tasks.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19550614)) - Or how OKRs can be weaponized to prevent top managers to mess with the (already established) schedule.

- [Why individual OKRs don't work for us](https://hrblog.spotify.com/2016/08/15/our-beliefs/) - Spotify decision to stop using OKRs for individuals.

- [Google's usage of OKRs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17492038) - OKR grades are public, but not used for promotion. It was never taken very seriously there.

- [Awesome OKR](https://github.com/domenicosolazzo/awesome-okr) - There is no shortage of content on how to measure and communicate objectives.

## Training

On mentoring, education and learning.

- [Developers mentoring other developers: practices I've seen work well](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/developers-mentoring-other-developers/) - Discusses mentorship practices that work well engineer-to-engineer.

- [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) - Very high-level guides and paths to learn different practice and tools.

## Communication

It is not only about reading, writing and talking. It encompass all the social practice and context sharing of the team's activities.

Especially a software team, which generates a huge amount of knowledge. All this knowledge is fragile and about to be lost for good. Unless you materialization it in the form of writing.

### Knowledge

On knowledge surrounding a team.

- [What senior engineers do: fix knowledge holes](http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3232) - “This is the textbook definition of a senior engineer. You see a problem, you solve it (thoroughly), you document it and you level up your team.”

- [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence) - “If you're considering nominating something for deletion, or changing a policy, because it doesn't appear to have any use or purpose, research its history first.” It's not we'd like to play conservative here, but because we need to fix the knowledge hole as described above.

- [You're Not Managing a Team of Software Engineers, You're Managing a Team of Writers](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/youre-not-managing-a-team-of-software-engineers-you-re-managing-a-team-of-writers-b263d3a10cc7) - Because writing software is “a creative process which is by its nature unpredictable and personal, in an environment which craves certainty, predictability and consistency.”

### Reading

Before you know how to write, you need to know how to read.

- [How to Read a Paper](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf) - Outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers.

### Documentation

- [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/) - There is four kinds of documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and reference. Each with their own structure and mode of writing.

- [Flying Circus Platform - Disaster recovery](https://flyingcircus.io/doc/reference/security/disaster-recovery.html#disaster-recovery) - Critical infrastructure which aims to be available 24/7 needs a [Disaster Recovery Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery). It generally takes the form of a document providing an overview of the expected severe failures and a set of procedures on how the system and the team operating it is prepared to deal with. The one linked here is a great example of such document, and is strong evidence the team is prepared for the worse.

### Writing

General advices on how to convey meaning and clarity by mastering the style. If badly written, your documentation is likely to have poor usage and utility.

## Re-organizations

As a manager, you have direct responsability of the structure of the team. Past a certain size (around 8 to 12 depending on sources), you no longer have time to work with direct ICs, so you need to re-organize the team.

At a company level, re-orgs are mostly strategic and your influence on them depends on your political acumen.

### Team-level

Feed it, grow it, and let it be a source of further strong teams. No rushing.”

- [Building a data team at a mid-stage startup: a short story](https://erikbern.com/2021/07/07/the-data-team-a-short-story.html) - Story of a manager trying to distill the concepts of a data-driven company while growing a tiny team of 3 people.

- “This is the managerialist dream. To replace employees' judgement and competence with a process and management methodology. (…) It never works.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20881308)). And why the retraining answer above is the best one.

- [I've Built Multiple Growth Teams. Here's Why I Won't Do It Again.](https://conversionxl.com/blog/dont-build-growth-teams/) - “Few folks understand probability, and most executives don't care about the data, regardless of what it says.”

### Company-level

My cautionary tale: this might only work up to a point depending on the company's culture.

- “When everything is great success, people behind that success shadow the people who could make success in the future. (…) Netflix is great example of how to do big transition right. Netflix was in renting DVDs by mail business. When the decision to move to streaming was made, Netflix CEO did not allow managers who responsible for DVD renting business into meetings where the future was planned.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21395557)).

Not the other way around. “Changes at the top — not speeches, training or hashtags — make the most cultural impact. If you want real and lasting cultural change, sweep away the made-men who succeeded under the previous culture and promote the people who look, act, and think more like their employees than their managers.”

### Acquisition

A special case of re-org, that might take the form of inclusion, absorbtion or dissolution of the acquired company.

- [How the Digg team was acquihired](https://lethain.com/digg-acquihire/) - Acqui-hire of a whole team can be seen as a type of reorg. In which managers will have to negotiate the new employment contracts in bulk in one or two days: “Because acquihires are “star” oriented, if you're a senior leaders who doesn't explicitly refuse to move forward, pressure will converge on you from all sides”.

Reason two: a change of activity can be a spur to creativity. Reason three for taking a short break: if we need rest to prevent exhaustion, a single, long vacation won't do the trick.”
