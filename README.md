# 👔 Awesome Engineering Team Management

A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions, industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last few years while [transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager](https://devtomanager.com/interviews/kevin-deldycke/). And later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right? ʘ‿ʘ).

It is on this substrate that I crafted my management style, as I found anchoring the later with [the usual labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_style#Types_of_management_styles) is way too limiting and short-sighted. Limiting as management is both of an art and a science. And short-sighted as a style shouldn't be taken at face-value and always be sensible to our fellow humans talents and the business context of the company.

## Engineering to Management Transition

The first step. The hardest: how to requalify oneself from an Individual Contributor (IC) to a front-line manager.

- You always been a developer. Being offered [a management position is not a promotion. It is a change in career](https://fractio.nl/2014/09/19/not-a-promotion-a-career-change/).

- [Responsibility vs. accountability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21892816) - The biggest difference between manager (accountable) and engineers (responsible): `“Bad things” happen for the person accountable, whereas the person responsible can move on to the next project.`.
- `It is a job where your goal is to try disappoint people most slowly.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18222488)).


## Building Teams

Whether you inherit an already existing team or have to start from scratch, you'll need to practice the art of building (and consolidating) them.

- [Building and Motivating Engineering Teams](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/11/building-and-motivating-engineering.html) - What DO engineers want? Money, purpose and respect.
- [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - `Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (…) The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.`.
- [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - `The practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.`.
- [Teams are like bread](https://blog.jessitron.com/2019/06/15/teams-are-like-bread/) - `If you have one team where the magic is flourishing, don't kill it. Feed it, grow it, and let it be a source of further strong teams. No rushing.`.
- [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article `would be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.`.


## Roles

On the profiles, attitude, behaviors, and expectations between developers, managers and executives.

### Executives

Executives are the senior/highest management layers of a company. They reports to a board of directors in bigger companies, or directly to the shareholders in smaller ones. Leadership is expected at this level. As a manager these are the people you report to.

- [What do executives do, anyway?](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926) - Paraphrasing [Andy Grove's book, High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679762884), `the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.`. The article also details the failures modes of a CEO: forcing his own decisions downstreams, or various ways of not resolving conflicts.
- [Executives ratify decisions made on the spot](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1088001688722644992) - Refines the concept above adapting [Tolstoy's thesis to business](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18089716).

And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

### Coding Challenge

The absence of coding exercise will left the door open to fraud. OTOH, if elistist challenges decrease the number of false-positive, you'll pass on perfectly capable and great developers. Now it is your job as manager to find balance between these two extremes, and set the tone on how to have the candidate demonstrate coding skills.

- [I thought that using loops was cheating…](https://www.facebook.com/spliceofficial/photos/a.555206991212765/679408552125941/?type=1&theater) - How much is too much? Libraries, wether software or audio loops, are tools. A typical case of [NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) transposed to music production.


## Team Dynamics

On the day-to-day dynamics of the team, and its interaction with other teams.

- [A Career Cold Start Algorithm](https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start) - The author developed an algorythm to ramp-up quickly when joining an existing team where he had a massive knowledge deficit and no pre-existing relationships.

(…) John always shared everything with us, even the “don't share this with your team” stuff. We were people he trusted, so it was as it should be. It made you feel like you were part of something greater.` Or why sharing some open secret promote strong trust in your entourage.
- [A conversation with Elon Musk about Starship](https://youtu.be/cIQ36Kt7UVg?t=203) - In a team with very talented contributors, everyone's is a chief engineer: you are expected to challenge the status-quo and questions other department's constraints.

- [OpenTeams](https://openteam.info) - `Teams can visualize their network of interactions, and also, cross this data with information on a teams demographic, professional, and psychological characteristics.`. As manager, make sure these metrics bring positive outcome to the team. It is easy to have them instrumentalized for political reasons.

- [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/) - `My boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was clean!

## Project Management

If product management is about *what* is to be developed of the product, then project management activities answers on *how* to deliver that development. It is all about the execution, with a particular attention to delivery critical path and planning.

But don't worry too much, every company has its own definition of the two roles, and sometimes hybrid positions.

- [Let's have no managers, instead of managers with no engineering experience](https://medium.com/hackernoon/lets-have-no-managers-instead-of-managers-with-no-engineering-experience-e8b7cd29d398) - The title is misleading, article's argument is: we don't need *project* managers if we already have *product* managers and scrum masters.

- [The art of destroying software](https://vimeo.com/108441214) - Greg Young described a good way to deal with requirements volatility: optimize from the beginning to be able to delete your code, and structure your code so that any part of it is no bigger than 1 week's worth of coding. So that any part can be re-written in 1 week.
- [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/) - `Start by accepting that change is inevitable. (…) As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned. (…) This means that no software product is ever exactly, perfectly satisfactory.`.

### Estimations

- [Dear Startup: You have no idea how much that costs.](http://kyleprifogle.com/dear-startup/) - `We are completely clueless about how long things should take.`. Here is a [trick to handle expectation of unreasonable estimates](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21069178).

## Agile

- [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Standup](https://kristoff.it/blog/good-bad-ugly-standup/) - Author experienced 3 formats of standups before ending with one working for his team, and concludes that `the details that make up a good meeting are subtle and the pursuit of an artificial standard of aesthetics will prevent you from doing the necessary experimentation to improve from an ugly equilibrium`.

One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20326074))


## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

KPIs are a set of quantitative measurements at the team or organizational level, to measure the success of the business.

- `Numerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.` - [W. Edwards Deming](https://quotes.deming.org/authors/W._Edwards_Deming/quote/2068-2)
- [SRE fundamentals: SLIs, SLAs and SLOs](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos.html) - If you are in the business of cloud services, these metrics are certainly great KPIs.
- `My team tracks life impact as a metric (pages outside business hours) and works to drive that down to zero.` ([source](https://twitter.com/dwc/status/962179099606200320)) - Maybe the best indicator of a happy team is how little it is disturbed outside office hours.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

OKRs are a framework. Extending KPIs, they applies individually to each members of an organization, down to the IC level. In theory, everyone is supposed to have its own set of OKRs.

- [OKRs from a development team's perspective](https://zafulabs.com/2019/05/24/okrs-from-a-development-teams-perspective/) - On how OKRs articulates with a backlog.

- [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) - Very high-level guides and paths to learn different practice and tools.


## Literacy

It is not only about reading and writing. It encompass all the social practice, context sharing and communication surrounding the activity and production of a team.

Especially a software team, which will generate a huge amount of knowledge. All this knowledge is fragile and about to be lost for good. Unless you materialization it in the form of writing.

### Knowledge

On knowledge surrounding a team.

- [What senior engineers do: fix knowledge holes](http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3232) - `This is the textbook definition of a senior engineer. You see a problem, you solve it (thoroughly), you document it and you level up your team.`.

It generally takes the form of a document providing an overview of the expected severe failures and a set of procedures on how the system and the team operating it is prepared to deal with. The one linked here is a great example of such document, and is strong evidence the team is prepared for the worse.

### Writing

## Politics

Here we are, at the intersection of power and influence lies the political game. If its nature and intensity is sourced from the company's core culture and history, you're unfortunately unlikely to avoid it past a certain hierarchical level. So be prepared.

- [HiPPO FAQ](http://bitly.com/HIPPOExplained) - HiPPO stands for `Highest Paid Person's Opinion`, a trait of dysfunctional culture, in which power politics trumps data.
- [*The Prince*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) - Machiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honor and power as a leader. Resorting to that level of politics in a company is a sure way to render the culture highly toxic, as well as corrupting and demoralizing the organization at all levels.
- [The Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/) - A cynical, bleak, but still fascinating take on the management ladder, based on *The Office*.

- `"You know your game fails when you read in the news about the feature you are supposed to have".` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20220484)). A team learning about its roadmap at the same time of the general public is a sure sign something is wrong.
- `In a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn't react. (sometimes called "triggering the antibodies").` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5541517)).
