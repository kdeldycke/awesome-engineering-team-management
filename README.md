# Awesome Engineering Team Management

A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions, industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last few years while transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager. And later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right? ʘ‿ʘ).

It is on this substrate that I crafted my management style, as I found anchoring the later with [the usual labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_style#Types_of_management_styles) is way too limiting and short-sighted. Limiting as management is both of an art and a science. And short-sighted as a style shouldn't be taken at face-value and always be sensible to our fellow humans talents and the business context of the company.


## Engineering to Management Transition

The first step. The hardest: how to requalify oneself from an Individual Contributior (IC) to a front-line manager.

* You always been a developer. Being offered [a management position is not a promotion. It is a change in career](https://fractio.nl/2014/09/19/not-a-promotion-a-career-change/).

## Building Teams

Either you inherit an already existing team of have to start from scratch, you'll need to practice the art of building (and consolidating) them.

Instead, the take home from this article `would be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.`


## Roles

On the profiles, attitude, behaviors, and expectations between developers, managers and executives.

### Executives

* [Identify what makes a great manager](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager/steps/learn-about-googles-manager-research/) - Google tried to prove managers don't matter. Instead, it discovered [10 Traits of the Very Best Ones](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/google-tried-to-prove-managers-dont-matter-instead-they-discovered-10-traits-of-very-best-ones.html).

That, also, is `[Baumol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease)` in action.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20448929)).

### Engineers

* [7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer](https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/) - TL;DR: `1. I’m a senior developer; 2. Everyone writes tests; 3. We’re so far behind everyone else (a.k.a. tech FOMO); 4. Code quality matters most; 5. Everything must be documented; 6. Technical debt is bad; 7. Seniority means being the best at programming`.

### Consultants

* `A consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).

And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

Still, google engineers already practice a culture close to what looks like the 10-points Agile manifesto. But that it.
* [Detecting Agile Bullshit](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF) - US Departement of Defense guide to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (“agile-scrum-fall”).


## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

KPIs are a set of quantitative measurements at the team or organizational level, to measure the sucess of the business.

* `Numerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.` - [W. Edwards Deming](https://quotes.deming.org/authors/W._Edwards_Deming/quote/2068-2)


## Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

Now that you've proven your worth as a front-line manager, what's the next step? These articles explore the follow-up roles, from managing managers to director, and everything in between.

## Politics

Here we are, at the intersection of power and influence lies the political game. If its nature and intensity is sourced from the company's core culture and history, you're unfortunately unlikely to avoid it past a certain hierarchical level. So be prepared.

* `The actual power wielded by a high level executive is usually inversely proportional to the size of the organization they manage.` (source: [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20260498) on [Why large companies are so difficult to rescue](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20260114)).
* [HiPPO FAQ](http://bitly.com/HIPPOExplained) - HiPPO stands for `Highest Paid Person's Opinion`, a trait of dysfunctional culture, in which power politics trumps data.
* [*The Prince*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) - Machiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honour and power as a leader. Resorting to that level of politics in a company is a sure way to render the culture highly toxic, as well as corrupting and demoralizing the organization at all levels.
* [The Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/) - A cynical, bleak, but still fascinating take on the management ladder, based on *The Office*.
* [The 48 Laws of Power](https://amzn.com/0140280197/?tag=kevideld-20) by Robert Greene - Can teach you how to cover your ass and be effective in a highly political org.


## Re-organizations

* `If you have dealt with large, completely incompetent organizations and wondered how the hell they actually keep going - theres your answer. If built correctly it's genuinely difficult to mess things up.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20533922)). I.e. the structure of the organization is quintessential to its longevity.
* [If I Close My Data Centers, What About the People/Jobs Lost?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17329028) - F50's data centers being migrated to commercial cloud provider. But what about the people currently doing legacy stuff? The answer: retrain.
* `This is the managerialist dream. To replace employees' judgement and competence with a process and management methodology. (...) It never works.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20881308)). And why the retraining answer above is the best one.
* [An Alternative Approach to Re-Orgs At Your Company](https://caseyaccidental.com/alternative-approach-re-orgs/) - `Trying not to repeat re-org mistakes, we started working on a structure that would make the re-org act like a feedback-fueled progress driven by the teams instead of by people above them.`. This is an attempt to extract from the ground up signals pointing to inadequate structure. My cautionary tale: this might only work up to a point depending on the company's culture.
